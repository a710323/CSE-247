Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1: The curve is n^2.

Question A2: We add a nth value, it takes n-1 ticks to add one item. The summation would be n^2

Question B1: It's a linear function because we don't a loop to find the end of the list. It's only take 5 ticks to add a element to the end of the list.

Question B2: One more pointer to a list node.

Question B3: It's not worthwhile if n = 1, in this case, it would be the same. But we waste a space to create list node. In other case, it'd be pretty good to add the node at the end of list. 

Question C1: 3n + 3 ticks. The loop runs n times, and each time would count 3 ticks, plus 3 tick outside the loop.

Question C2: We introduce length instant variable, and add one to it each time we add a number in list.

Question C3: I just ran it! We add a single operation. 

Question D1: \Theta(n);

Question D2: add another pointer, and change the position of the pointer (mid.next). 

Question D3: int max = null; each time we add element, check if it's greater than max, if yes, update the max value.

Question D4: Seems like impossible. When we delete a number that's max, then we have to go through all the linkedlist to find the max.
