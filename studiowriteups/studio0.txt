Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question PS1: The charts produced by Quadratic are more like an exponential function. Unlike the charts produced by linear, which are more like an linear function.

Question PS2: The code in Quadratic has two loops in it.
	
Question PS3: The shape of the plots are almost unchanged, but the values in ticker grow rapidly if I place ticker.tick(); in every operation.  
	
Question PS4: In the most simple case, I would say the ticker and time value would be n square.

Question PS5: The time still unchanged, the the ticker would reduce to 1.
	
Question A1: It's a straight horizontal line. Because no matter the value of n is, the for loop would execute exactly 100000000 times. 
	
Question A2: Linear.
	
Question A3: the value of n affects the loop.
	
Question A4: Still linear. the tick value is different because we tick n times for a array with size n. so bigger size of array, takes more time. n ticks to create with an array with n.

Question A5: The decimal group finish first. logx - 1 = n and truncate. x is the number, and n is the marks that decimal group needs to write down the number. Starting from number 2, decimal group would perform faster than tally group.

Question A6: formula for marks down binary method is m = (log base2 x) + 1. ratio: (logbase10(x)+1)/(logbase2(x)+1)

Question A7: choosing decimal would be more efficient than binary. tally is the less efficient way to mark the number down. Except the case of number equals to 1. decimal is better.  
	
Question C1: It's a function of n square.

Question C2: It reflects that unless the array has no space, it doesn't need to double the space, but it still need to assign old array to new one. it takes time.

Question C3: The simple approximation would be like square root.
	
Question D1: (n square + n ) / 2, it matches what we see at growsbyone
	
Question D2:
