Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question PS1: The charts produced by Quadratic are more like an exponential function. Unlike the charts produced by linear, which are more like an linear function.

Question PS2: The code in Quadratic has two loops in it.
	
Question PS3: The shape of the plots are almost unchanged, but the values in ticker grow rapidly if I place ticker.tick(); in every operation.  
	
Question PS4: In the most simple case, I would say the ticker and time value would be n square.

Question PS5: The time still unchanged, the the ticker would reduce to 1.
	
Question A1: It's a straight horizontal line. Because no matter the value of n is, the for loop would execute exactly 100000000 times. 
	
Question A2: Linear.
	
Question A3: the value of n affects the loop.
	
Question A4: Still linear. the tick value is different because we tick n times for a array with size n. so bigger size of array, takes more time. n ticks to create with an array with n.

Question A5: The decimal group finish first. logx - 1 = n and truncate. x is the number, and n is the marks that decimal group needs to write down the number. Starting from number 2, decimal group would perform faster than tally group.

Question A6: formula for marks down binary method is m = (log base2 x) + 1. ratio: (logbase10(x)+1)/(logbase2(x)+1)

Question A7: choosing decimal would be more efficient than binary. tally is the less efficient way to mark the number down. Except the case of number equals to 1. decimal is better.
